The views are so wide that George Everest, a surveyor general after whom the world's tallest peak is named, used the vantage point of Churdhar to survey much of the western Himalayas from. Peaks around Badrinath and Kedarnath can be seen from here and towards the south, vast plains of the Gangetic plains open up to meet the horizon. Churdhar is accessible from three routes, Chopal, Nohradhar and Haripurdhar stations. Passing through small villages, cultivated fields and alpine meadows the trek is moderately difficult but rewarding. Summiting the peak, on a clear day is rewarded with a riot of views. Just below the summit is the temple of Shirgul Devta, worshipped in the form of a lingam as Chooreshwar Mahadev. At the peak is a recently built temple of Lord Shiva. Around the massive mountain there is a wildlife sanctuary. This wilderness is a wealth of herbs and beautiful alpine flora. Walking through the sanctuary one can spot monal, koklass and khaleej pheasants.

Making way through thick oak and deodar forests with scattered rhododendron flowers in the path, this moderate trek starts at Galu temple, about 3 km from Dharamkot and 10 km from Mcleodgan). The last stretches of the trek are demanding as you make your way up 22 gruelling loops to an open camping ground. Popular among weekenders and day-hikers, the trek offers chances of brief but thrilling encounters with beautiful birds and wild animals. The walk down is an easy run into the breeze. Triund is 7 km from Mcleodganj. High altitude and proximity to Laka glacier and Indrahar Pass makes weather of Triund highly unpredictable as a hot and sunny day can turn into a small snowstorm in matter of minutes.\"]\n        },
