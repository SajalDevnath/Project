Tracing roots to Vedic times, the rich heritage of Himachal Pradesh did\r\n        find safe retreats from frequent invasions in Himalayan valleys, at\r\n        isolated kingdoms and at remote habitations. The mighty mountains have\r\n        always been counted upon as life-giving, where the seeker found shelter\r\n        and solace. Mystical practices of primitive Shamanism have peacefully\r\n        existed alongside the evolved faiths of Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism\r\n        for thousands of years. Life in villages centered around temples of Devi\r\n        and Devta (gods and goddesses), with a shaman in trance often being the\r\n        adjudicator of good and evil in society.\r\n      </h5>\r\n      <br></br>\r\n      <br></br>\r\n      <Container>\r\n        <Tab.Container id=\"list-group-tabs-example\" defaultActiveKey=\"#link1\">\r\n          <Row>\r\n            <Col sm={2}>\r\n              <ListGroup>\r\n                <ListGroup.Item action href=\"#link1\">\r\n                  <Icon.HeartFill color=\"white\" size={20} /> <h6>ART</h6>\r\n                </ListGroup.Item>\r\n                <br></br>\r\n                <ListGroup.Item action href=\"#link2\">\r\n                  <Icon.Snow2 color=\"white\" size={20} />\r\n                  <h6>Crafts of Himachal</h6>\r\n                </ListGroup.Item>\r\n                <br></br>\r\n                <ListGroup.Item action href=\"#link3\">\r\n                  <Icon.MusicNoteBeamed color=\"white\" size={20} /> <h6>Songs & Dance</h6>\r\n                </ListGroup.Item>\r\n                <br></br>\r\n                <ListGroup.Item action href=\"#link4\">\r\n                  <Icon.Person color=\"white\" size={20} />\r\n                  <h6>Attire</h6>\r\n                </ListGroup.Item>\r\n              </ListGroup>\r\n            </Col>\r\n            <Col sm={8}>\r\n              <Tab.Content>\r\n                <Tab.Pane eventKey=\"#link1\">\r\n                  The art of Himachal has grown out from a fusion of cultural\r\n                  strains, migrations and religious beliefs. Several surviving\r\n                  works have found expression in wall murals, illustrated books,\r\n                  miniatures and religious paintings Patronized by the rulers of\r\n                  hill valley kingdoms, Indigenous art forms blended with Mughal\r\n                  style blossomed into what collectively has come to known as\r\n                  the famed Kangra school of paintings. Regional specific art\r\n                  styles in Basholi Kalam, Kangra Kalam, Mandi Kalam, Chamba\r\n                  Kalam, Guler Kalam, Kullu Kalam, Arki Kalam, Bilaspur Kalam,\r\n                  Nurpur Kalam and others can only be differentiated by\r\n                  connoisseurs and collectors.

Spread expansively over an area of 4 km, the fort\r\n                  guarded by high walls and ramparts was severely damaged in the\r\n                  devastating Kangra earthquake of 1905 that practically\r\n                  flattened most building and monuments in the region.
