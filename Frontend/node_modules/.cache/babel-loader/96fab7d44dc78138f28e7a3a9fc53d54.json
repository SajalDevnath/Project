That situation exists because the major Himalayan rivers, such\r\n          as the Indus, the Brahmaputra, the Sutlej, and at least two headwaters\r\n          of the Ganges—the Alaknanda and the Bhagirathi—are probably older than\r\n          the mountains they traverse. It is believed that the Himalayas were\r\n          uplifted so slowly that the old rivers had no difficulty in continuing\r\n          to flow through their channels and, with the rise of the Himalayas,\r\n          acquired an even greater momentum, which enabled them to cut their\r\n          valleys more rapidly. The elevation of the Himalayas and the deepening\r\n          of the valleys thus proceeded simultaneously. As a result, the\r\n          mountain ranges emerged with a completely developed river system cut\r\n          into deep transverse gorges that range in depth from 5,000 to 16,000\r\n          feet (1,500 to 5,000 metres) and in width from 6 to 30 miles (10 to 50\r\n          km). The earlier origin of the drainage system explains the\r\n          peculiarity that the major rivers drain not only the southern slopes\r\n          of the Great Himalayas but, to a large extent, its northern slopes as\r\n          well, the water divide being north of the crest line.\r\n        </Col>\r\n      </Row>\r\n      <br></br>\r\n      <br></br>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Himalayas;\r\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
