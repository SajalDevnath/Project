Only whwn the British established their chain of\r\n            hill sations did tourism receive recognition in the state.Tourism\r\n            activity received a shot in the arm when British declared Shimla\r\n            \"The Summer Capital of India\" in 1864. Post independence, more\r\n            investment in the infrastructure sector led to opening up of Tourism\r\n            in the state. However the biggest boost to tourism occured in the\r\n            mid 80s and 90s.\r\n          </h5>\r\n          <br></br>\r\n          <br></br>\r\n          <h5>\r\n            While traditionally Himachal was known as a summer destination, the\r\n            Department of Tourism & Civil Aviation has taken special efforts to\r\n            break the seasonality factor and has developed diversified tourism\r\n            products to attract tourists in other seasons too. Now Himachal is\r\n            known as \"A Destination for All Seasons and All Reasons\". In fact,\r\n            the Department has laid a special emphasis on the developement of\r\n            activity-based tourism and opening up of new sub destinations. To\r\n            promote tourism in the countryside and to unexplored areas,\r\n            appropriate infrasture is being developed within available\r\n            resources. By focussing on quality tourists, the Department aims at\r\n            promoting sustainable tourism and encouraging private sector to\r\n            develop tourism related infrastructure in the state without\r\n            disturbing the Existing ecology and environment.\r\n          </h5>\r\n          <br></br>\r\n        </Container>\r\n      </Figure.Caption>\r\n    </Figure>\r\n

Rivers Beas, Ravi\r\n          and Chenab, threee tributaries rivers of River Indus, originates from\r\n          Himachal.\r\n          <br></br>\r\n          River Satluj, like the Indus and Brahmaputra, is one of the few rivers\r\n          that cuts through the Himalayas. It enters Himachal at Shipki La and\r\n          passes through a deep gorgr in Kinnaur and leaves the state at Bhakra\r\n          in a westward flow. Ridges of the mountains on the eastern flank of\r\n          Satluj divide north India into the Indus and Ganga basins. Shimla, the\r\n          state's capital city, islocated along this ridge line that strecthes\r\n          into Kinnaur. From the east side of Shimla, rainwater and snow melt\r\n          flows into the Bay of Bengal and from the western side it end up in\r\n          the Arabian Sea.\r\n          <br></br>\r\n          The Great Himalayas, which normally would form the main water divide\r\n          throughout their entire length, function as such only in limited\r\n          areas. That situation exists because the major Himalayan rivers, such\r\n          as the Indus, the Brahmaputra, the Sutlej, and at least two headwaters\r\n          of the Ganges—the Alaknanda and the Bhagirathi—are probably older than\r\n          the mountains they traverse. It is believed that the Himalayas were\r\n          uplifted so slowly that the old rivers had no difficulty in continuing\r\n          to flow through their channels and, with the rise of the Himalayas,\r\n          acquired an even greater momentum, which enabled them to cut their\r\n          valleys more rapidly. The elevation of the Himalayas and the deepening\r\n          of the valleys thus proceeded simultaneously. As a result, the\r\n          mountain ranges emerged with a completely developed river system cut\r\n          into deep transverse gorges that range in depth from 5,000 to 16,000\r\n          feet (1,500 to 5,000 metres) and in width from 6 to 30 miles (10 to 50\r\n          km). The earlier origin of the drainage system explains the\r\n          peculiarity that the major rivers drain not only the southern slopes\r\n          of the Great Himalayas but, to a large extent, its northern slopes as\r\n          well, the water divide being north of the crest line.\r\n        </Col>\r\n      </Row>\r\n      <br></br>\r\n      <br></br>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Himalayas;\r\n","D:\\Project\\Frontend\\tour\\src\\Components\\Otp.js",[],"D:\\Project\\Frontend\\tour\\src\\Components\\Cuisine.js",["194","195","196","197","198","199","200","201","202","203"],"import React from \"react\";\r\nimport img1 from \"../Images/card29.jpg\";\r\nimport NavbarHead from \"./Navbar\";\r\nimport {\r\n  Container,\r\n  Popover,\r\n  Table,\r\n  Form,\r\n  Card,\r\n  Button,\r\n  Image,\r\n  Nav,\r\n  FormControl,\r\n  Row,\r\n  Col,\r\n  NavDropdown,\r\n} from \"react-bootstrap\";\r\n\r\nfunction Cuisine() {\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n      <NavbarHead />\r\n      <Card border=\"light\">\r\n        <Card.Img variant=\"top\" src={img1} />\r\n        <Card.Body>\r\n          <Card.Title>\r\n            <h2>Cuisine</h2>\r\n          </Card.Title>\r\n        </Card.Body>\r\n      </Card>\r\n      <br></br>\r\n      <br></br>\r\n      <Container>\r\n        <h6>\r\n          Varied as the land, different valley regions of Himachal have held\r\n          onto age-old traditions in dress, music, dance styles, architecture,\r\n          agricultural practices but it is the tantalising palate with a variety\r\n          of cuisines on offer that can grip a traveller to come back looking\r\n          for more. Drawn from the farms and pastures the land grows, many\r\n          dishes make a liberal use of the produce, herbs, nuts, fruits, milk\r\n          and milk products. In many belts, non vegetarian food is the norm and\r\n          most meals are centered around meat, cereals and lentils.

A Mandi\r\n          Dham is much different from a Chamba, Xangra, Bilaspur, Shimla,\r\n          Sirmour or Kullu Dham. Each region or valley has its own set of\r\n          favourite dishes, cooked in a distinctly different style which makes\r\n          these feasts very popular at food festivals or when partaking in one\r\n          during a visit to any of these regions. A typical Chamba Dham would\r\n          open with rice and green lentils (moong daal), followed by Madrah\r\n          (kidney beans or white grams cooked in yoghurt), boor ki karl and dark\r\n          lentils (mash ki daal).\r\n          <br></br>\r\n          <br></br>\r\n          <br></br>\r\n          The meal is tapered with Khutta made of Gur (brown sugar) and tamarind\r\n          and for a dessert there is Mittha-sweetened rice, richly garnished\r\n          with raisins and dry fruits. In the highlands of Lahaul, Spiti and\r\n          Kinnaur, food has marked Tibetan influence with most dishes made out\r\n          of coarse grains of buckwheat, millet and barley that are locally\r\n          grown. Thupa, a popular dish, has meat chunks, vegetables and noodles\r\n          dipped in a fiery curry, Butter tea (Salty tea), known as Thang in\r\n          Kinnaur/Spiti is made by vigorous churning of butter, salt and special\r\n          tea leaves. For the long cold winter months this a very energising\r\n          beverage. The Momo, a Tibetan dish, is a very popular street food\r\n          readily available in Shimla, Manali, Dharamshala, Dalhousle and other\r\n          places. Cooked vegetables or minced meat with seasoning and spices is\r\n          wrapped in wheat flour dough. After steaming them. Momo's are ready to\r\n          be served.

Served as a stand alone bread or\r\n          savoured with daal or mutton, the salty or sweet filling Siddu has\r\n          found its way into many native restaurants menus. A non-vegetarian\r\n          would be left smacking his fingers when served with Khamod Meat, a\r\n          Chamba speciality of mutton cooked in ghee with curd, spices and\r\n          garnished with cashew nuts, dry dates and raisins. A fresh catch of\r\n          trout fish, roasted, steam cooked or cooked in a curry is a delicacy\r\n          in Barot, Sangla, Pabbar and Kullu-Manali valleys Other locally\r\n          popular dishes include Khatta Karal meat of Kangra, and parts of Mandi\r\n          and Sepu Vadi of Mandi, Patande of Sirmaur, Babru and Nasastha of\r\n          Shimla.

The place only got noticed when\r\n            Raja Joginder Sen of Mandi royal house in 1925 decided to harness\r\n            the rivers waters for a hydropower plant.

The Nagru Wildlife Sanctuary, upstream of Barot, conserves\r\n            rare Himalayan flora and fauna. Besides game fishing for exotic\r\n            trout fish, the valley has ample opportunities for trekking, with\r\n            one route going over Bhubu Pass into Kullu valley and the other more\r\n            difficult one, going over Thamsar Pass, origin of Uhl river, into\r\n            Bada Bangal valley would get the adrenalin of any seasoned trekker\r\n            going.

The views are so wide\r\n            that George Everest, a surveyor general after whom the world's\r\n            tallest peak is named, used the vantage point of Churdhar to survey\r\n            much of the western Himalayas from.

Popular among weekenders and day-hikers, the\r\n            trek offers chances of brief but thrilling encounters with beautiful\r\n            birds and wild animals. The walk down is an easy run into the\r\n            breeze. Triund is 7 km from Mcleodganj.

An anglers\r\n            sporting delight, both Brown and Rainbow trout are also commercially\r\n            farmed as table fish.\r\n          </Col>\r\n          <Col>\r\n            <Card.Img src={img9} />\r\n          </Col>\r\n        </Row>\r\n      </Container>\r\n      <br></br>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Floraandfauna;\r\n","D:\\Project\\Frontend\\tour\\src\\Components\\Adventure.js",["223","224","225","226","227","228","229","230","231","232"],"import React from \"react\";\r\nimport NavbarHead from \"./Navbar\";\r\nimport img1 from \"../Images/card30.jpg\";\r\nimport img2 from \"../Images/card31.jpg\";\r\nimport img3 from \"../Images/card32.jpg\";\r\nimport img4 from \"../Images/card33.jpg\";\r\nimport img5 from \"../Images/card34.jpg\";\r\nimport img6 from \"../Images/card35.jpg\";\r\nimport img7 from \"../Images/card36.jpg\";\r\nimport img8 from \"../Images/card37.jpg\";\r\nimport img9 from \"../Images/card38.jpg\";\r\nimport img10 from \"../Images/card39.jpg\";\r\nimport img11 from \"../Images/card40.jpg\";\r\nimport img12 from \"../Images/card41.jpg\";\r\nimport img13 from \"../Images/card42.jpg\";\r\nimport img14 from \"../Images/card43.jpg\";\r\nimport img15 from \"../Images/card44.jpg\";\r\nimport {\r\n  Container,\r\n  Popover,\r\n  Table,\r\n  Form,\r\n  Card,\r\n  CardGroup,\r\n  Button,\r\n  Image,\r\n  Nav,\r\n  FormControl,\r\n  Row,\r\n  Col,\r\n  NavDropdown,\r\n} from \"react-bootstrap\";\r\n\r\nfunction Adventure() {\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n      <NavbarHead />\r\n      <Card border=\"light\">\r\n        <Card.Img variant=\"top\" src={img1} />\r\n        <Card.Body>\r\n          <Card.Title>\r\n            <h2>Adventure</h2>\r\n          </Card.Title>\r\n        </Card.Body>\r\n      </Card>\r\n      <br></br>\r\n      <Container>\r\n        <CardGroup>\r\n          <Card>\r\n            <Card.Img variant=\"top\" src={img2} />\r\n            <Card.Body>\r\n              <Card.Title>River Rafting</Card.Title>\r\n              <br></br>\r\n              <Card.Text>\r\n                Rushing downstream with the strong river flows, negotiating\r\n                turbulent rapids, water droplets hitting you in the face; white\r\n                water rafting is an adventure sport that gets up the adrenaline\r\n                working thick and fast.\r\n              </Card.Text>\r\n            </Card.Body>\r\n          </Card>\r\n          <Card>\r\n            <Card.Img variant=\"top\" src={img3} />\r\n            <Card.Body>\r\n              <Card.Title>Still Water Sports</Card.Title>\r\n              <br></br>\r\n              <Card.Text>\r\n                Backwaters of dams built have created many man made lakes on\r\n                rivers flowing through the state.
